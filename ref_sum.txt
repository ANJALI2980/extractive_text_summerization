Many researchers and agencies have been deploying AI to prepare a specific database of marine species for marine management.Recently,the AI platform developed in association with Microsoft is an attempt to automate the exhaustive process of counting local fish stocks and identify the different varieties of fish in the oceans.They claim that their machine learning model is now capable of identifying the species with high accuracy.An AI program developed by the researchers at North Carolina State University can automatically identify species or microscopic marine organisms. This could be the first step in developing a robotic system that can provide a clearer picture of the worldâ€™s oceans, both past and present.The program is capable of identifying six species of foraminifera.
